# **OpenIPSL**: Open iTesla Power System Library:
The OpenIPSL or Open-Instance Power System Library is a fork of of the [iTesla Power System Library](https://github.com/itesla/ipsl) developed and maintained by the [SmarTS Lab](https://www.kth.se/en/ees/omskolan/organisation/avdelningar/epe/research/smart-transmission-systems-laboratory-smarts-lab-1.627203) research group, collaborators and friends (contributions are welcome!).

The iPSL is a [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org) library developed during the [iTesla project](http://www.itesla-project.eu/). The members of this project at SmarTS Lab where key developers of the iPSL until March 31, 2016, when the iTesla project was completed.
As iPSL is part of the iTesla Tool, and thus, it is subject to the needs of the consortium that develops the iTesla tool, We decided to create the OpenIPSL fork in order to develop the library in the direction that most favors researchers and teachers/professors. 

As such, the purpose of OpenIPSL are to be used as a research library (therefore frequent release times may be available), with maximum compatibility with OpenModelica (to provide a free/libre and cost-free alternative for power system dynamic simulation), to provide as many as possible typical "test networks" for use in research and teaching, and to be developed in such way that the library can efficiently be used for power system simulation within Modelica-based workflows (i.e. helping to give reference power system models for development and testing of Modelica back-end compilers) when faced with power system simulation challenges. 

## Notice to Users:
This project encompasses the development of a Modelica library for power system simulation.
As such, there are no solver tools provided in this repository (no Power Flow Solvers, no Time-Domain solvers, etc.).
You can find more information on the [Wiki - Page] (update link).

## Documentation:
Currently, we are developing an 'application guide' with examples how to use the library and documentation on many of the test networks developed by different people.
Documentation on the use of thi library will most likely be in the form of tutorials, as the use of Modelica tools is not the main interest of this fork.

You can follow the following issues to know about our progress: [Application Guide](update link) and [Test Networks](update link).

## Contributing:
Contributions to the library are welcome and can be submitted in the form of pull requests to this repository.
Contributions can be of different nature, such as addition of a new component model, re-organisation of the structure of the library, change in the development practices, etc. Please post your suggestion in the "Issues" tab

Please consult the [contribution guidelines](update link).

## Citing iPSL in Publications:
If you use iPSL in your work or research, all we ask you in exchange is that you **cite the reference publications**, according to your use.
Please consult our [Publication list](update link), for browsing the reference publications

You are also welcome to submit your contributions as stated above.
