<p>This package illustrates how it is possible to model a 9-bus system and simulate it using Modelica and the OpenIPSL.</p> 
<p>The simulation of this system also illustrates how oscillations occur on top of each other in a real system, showing that many modes can be excited with severe disturbances such as a three-phase-to-ground fault.</p>
