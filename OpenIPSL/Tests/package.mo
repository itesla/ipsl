<p>
The systems within this package are intentionally small, employing a small number of models, allowing the user to test and evaluate the behavior of the model of interest.
</p>
<p>
These systems are also ideal for fiding model malfunctions and are used by developers when testing/debugging component models.
</p>
<p>
These test systems are intended to work in different Modelica-compliant software.
</p>
<p>
The test systems are usually simulated between 5 and 20 seconds. Variables of interest are usually related to the model of interest.
